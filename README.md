### The Challenge

You are implementing a hangman game, with a program that can automatically play the game for you.

The game has the following methods designed:
```
start() # starts the game
word() # shows the current word
guess() # make a letter guess
win() # have you won the game?
death() # are you dead?
```

#### The Challenge:
You must modify `hangman.py` to be able to start a hangman game, play it automatically until you are dead, or until you have won, then exit
